# Exploratory Data Analysis Overview
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a method for understanding a dataset thoroughly, revealing hidden patterns, and gaining insights for more in-depth analysis. It often uses statisical graphics and visuals to do so, as these can often be useful tools for exploring a dataset, but this is not a requirement for an EDA.

**What is your overall goal when doing an EDA?**  
The primary goal of EDA is to understand and learn things about the dataset in a general way. By examining its characteristics, the analyst can uncover patterns, identify outliers, and establish relationships between variables. This understanding serves as the foundation for further analysis.

**What methods are important?**  
There are several important methods that can be part of an EDA, including:

 - **Summary Statistics:** Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance (among others) can provide a quick overview of your dataset's center and spread.
 - **Data Visualization:** Creating various types of plots like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and density plots can be helpful for numeric variables in visually exploring the distributions, identify outliers, and recognize patterns. Contingency tables and bar plots can also be useful in exploring categorical variables.
 - **Profiling Variables:** Exploring the different types of variables that are present in the dataset is a very valuable step in understanding the dataset as a whole. This can include figuring out what they are measuring, identifying the classification of variable, such as continuous, discrete, or categorical, and looking for any missing values within each variable and figuring out why those values are missing.
 - **Correlation Analysis:** Examining the correlations between numerical variable can be very insightful in exploring a dataset. It can help identify strong relationships between variables, as well as any potential dependencies. Correlations between predictor variables are especially useful to be aware of when conducting a multivariate analysis.

**What things do you try to look for?**  
During an EDA, here are some things that may be helpful to look out for and identify:  

- **Missing Values:** Identify any missing data and devise a plan for handling it, as missing data can significantly impact on the analysis. If possible, trying to understand why the data is missing can help if understanding the best way to handle it.
- **Data Distribution:** Examining the shape, center, and spread of the data can provide meaningful insights. Is it normally distributed, skewed left or right, or exhibiting any other patterns?
- **Outliers:** Detecting data points that deviate significantly from the distribution is an important step, as they can point to data anomalies or interesting insights. Outliers do not always mean that there is something wrong with the data, but it is better to know that they are there when conducting an analysis.
- **Correlations:** As mentioned above, investigating relationships between variables can help you understand the connections within your dataset.

**Conclusion**
EDA is an important first step in the data analysis process. Using EDA, you can gain a deeper understanding of your data, which makes it easier to navigate the dataset and lays a solid foundation for an future analyses.
