# ST558 Project 2
\
For this project I created functions that pull to pull data from the balldontlie API. This database provides access to statistics from the NBA, consisting of season averages as well as individual game stats for players from 1946 to present. This is a free API that does not require an API key to access.  


I knew I wanted to do this project on a sports API, preferably basketball data, and after a lot of research and investigating different APIs, this one seemed like it had the best instructions for pulling data. There were some issues that I needed to work through, like it only allows 100 rows of data to be pull on each API request. I was able to learn a way to loop through multiple request and vertically merge the data together to pull larger amounts of data.  

One thing I would do differently is start this project earlier, since now I am trying to get the github-pages site to work. I was originally able to get the template .Rmd file to work, but now after switching my repo back to public, when I click the link it says 404 File not found.  

Update: I realized that I needed to re-do some of the instructions after putting my sight back on public. The branch got set back to None under Build and Deployment, so I needed to set it back to Main and it works now.
